//Functions can be used to perform some set of actions
//It increases code reusability as we can use the funtion as many times as we want.
//we have to just call the function.

let greet = function(){
  console.log("Good Morning"); 
}
//another way - 
function greet1 () {
  console.log("Good Morning"); 
}

//Using arrow Function -
let greet2 = () =>{
  console.log("Good Morning"); 
}
